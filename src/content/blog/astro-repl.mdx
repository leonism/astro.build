The Astro team proudly presents the new [Astro REPL:](https://astro.build/play) compile Astro right in your browser. Use it to explore Astro's HTML-based component language, debug issues, or even prototype an entire webpage. It's powered by Astroâ€™s **new WASM compiler** (written in Go) that runs anywhere and can rebuild files in an instant.
